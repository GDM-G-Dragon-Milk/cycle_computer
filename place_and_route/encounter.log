**WARN: (ENCEXT-6202):	In addition to the technology file, capacitance table file is specified for all RC corners. If the technology file for all RC corners is already specified, the capacitance table file is not required for preRoute and postRoute extraction. In a new session, the capacitance table files can be removed from the create_rc_corner command. In this case, the technology file will be used for preRoute extraction and effort level medium/high/signoff of postRoute extraction.
