# Cycle Computer
## OverView:
This is the ARM SoC Cycle Computer Group Project at University of Southampton in 2023.

Our bicycle computer System on Chip (SoC) is powered by the ARM Cortex-M0 core and is designed to provide riders with accurate 
and real-time information on their cycling performance. The SoC is equipped with two Hall sensors that detect the rotation of the wheel and the pedal, allowing for precise measurement of speed, distance, and other important metrics. The device also features two input buttons called “Mode” and “Trip” that allow for easy switching between display modes and adjustment of tire size and rider weight for more accurate calculations. With our SoC, riders can easily track their performance, including distance travelled, average and maximum speeds, riding time, and calories burned.

Our group members are: Yechengnuo Zhang, Yueran Wei, Jiashu Hu and Zhipeng Zhao.

## Modes & Functions of the computer

The cycle computer supports the following 7 functions:
- Distance travelled (Odometer).
- Duration of the ride (Trip Timer).
- Current speed (Speedometer).
- Pedal cadence (Cadence meter).
- Average speed
- Maximum speed
- Calorie cost
